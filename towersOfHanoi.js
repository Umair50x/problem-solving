Towers of Hanoi problem

    we have 3 towers and several rings
    The rings need to be in ascending order smallest on top largest on the bottom of a pillar
    one tower has stack of unordered rings which needs to be shifted from 1st tower to the 3rd tower
    the 2nd middle tower is a buffer b/w the two; it is going to help us in moving

    //take out all the rings and put them into the middle until we reach the biggest
    //put the biggest on the 3rd tower
    //recursively do until all of them are stacked ascending
